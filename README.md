**Customer Segmentation Analysis – Travel Agency Dataset**



This project demonstrates a customer segmentation analysis using Python on a dataset of 2,000 customers for a travel agency. The goal is to identify distinct customer groups based on their demographic and behavioral characteristics, to support targeted marketing strategies.



**Project Overview**



1. Objective: Identify meaningful customer segments to inform marketing and business decisions.



2\. Data: Demographic data includes age, gender, annual income, and marital status of 2,000 customers.



3\. Approach:



* Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand patterns and distributions.
* Apply K-means++ and Agglomerative Clustering for segmentation.
* Profile each cluster and compare the results from different clustering techniques.
* Provide actionable marketing insights based on cluster analysis.



4\. Techniques \& Tools

* Programming Language: Python
* Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
* Analytics Methods: EDA, data standardisation (StandardScaler), clustering (K-means++, Agglomerative)
* Visualisation: Histograms, pie charts, cluster plots
